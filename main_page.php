<b> Get Ready for Another Season of Breathtaking Football </b>\n 
My Footy Project  provides opportunities for the participants to compete in a tournament against other students, faculty/staff members, graduate students, student groups, and recreational center members while rest of the audience would be able to follow the results and statistics of the tournament. This project would be open to anyone that is interested in the tournament. The application would let the users register their teams. When the quota of the teams in the tournament is reached, the application would automatically draw the teams into round-robin groups. The teams would play one game against each other and top 2 teams from each group would move into knockout rounds. Automatic draw would occur in the knockout stages and pit the teams against each other. Users can also view the fixtures, results and important tournament statistics. Registered users would also be able to buy merchandise of the teams participating in the tournament. \n

Last season, 16 teams registered and played out their hearts out. If you are interested, click on the link below and be part of this amazing project. \n
